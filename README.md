## How To Use

### Quick Start

Create a project on [typst.app](https://typst.app), copy paste everything in https://github.com/skyzh/chicv/blob/master/cv.typ, and all done!

### Customize your CV

To change the text size, you can uncomment the lines in `cv.typ` and set to your choice. (Recommended text size for CV is from 10pt to 12pt)

You can also change the page margin in `cv.typ` to fit in more contents in a single page. The margin default is set to `(x: 0.9cm, y: 1.3cm)`.

Don't forget to include `#chiline()` every time you open a new section, this line acts as a perfect split.

For basic typst syntax, check this template as a reference, it's super easy to understand and use!
